# Jumper (With music and sound FX!)

## Welcome to Purgatory George!

Care to play a game, George?

To be honest, I have been feeling quite lazy as of late...

Tell you what, you go around and collect the souls of all the sinners milling about your section of purgatory, and I, the kind and fair warden of this place will let you go to Heaven.

Great deal, no?

These sinners whose souls you are collecting have been turned into gold coins for their greed. They are blind and move in random directions. But don't let that fool you, a fast moving one moving in the wrong direction could still knock you out!

Not to worry though. You're already DEAD, George! If you get knocked out, you'll just end up right where you started. An endless loop of misery. Erm. I mean fun! 

To capture these souls, jump using SPACE BAR and land on top of their heads! 

Obviously, move left and right with the left and right arrow keys. Purgatory is strange in that its very 2D. But you'll get used to it eventually :)

Well. Once again. Welcome to purgatory! I do hope you enjoy your stay.


## Controls
- Move Left and Right with Left and Right keyboard keys
- Jump with Space Bar

A win takes you to "Heaven"
You can't lose in this game :D

## NOTE:
Runs in the XCODE IDE only (with cmd+r). There seems to be an issue with the generated .app and detecting the path to the resources directory!

P.S. Most important places to look for someone who is grading this would probably be under "GameState.cpp". Look for the functions "Movement" and "Update". 

Jumping, landing on an enemy, or getting hit by an enemy all cause sound effects

Winning and going to the Victory screen makes everything white until you enter another game. (This is on purpose)

Cheers! =D
